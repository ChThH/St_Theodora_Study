## Going Inward
1.	Metropolitan Anthony suggested that we direct prayer to ourselves, were you able to practice this approach?
2.	In choosing a prayer (words of a prayer), what three (3) ways approaches can we use?
3.	Metropolitan Anthony states that we are delusional if we expect to pray in which type of approach to choosing our words?
4.	Why are the Psalms so important in our prayer life? Why are the prayers of the Saints important to learn, and why are they special?
5.	What does Metropolitan Anthony mean by “A prayer makes sense only if it is lived?  Have you tried to “live” a conviction from your prayer for any period of time?  
6.	What time limit is suggested for your prayer sessions?  Why?
7.	What does he mean by taking the words (of our prayers) for what they mean (ordinary speech), but we don’t connect them with other things we know?
8.	What do we need to be aware of (within ourselves), when asking for God for help with our sins and temptations?
9.	Is it important to have physical effort during prayer?  Why?
10.	What “monsters” do we meet as we go deeper into prayer?  How do we deal with them?
11.	Why is it important to “sit with yourself in the face of boredom”?  Can you name a Saint that has a quote that applicable to this question?
12.	What is meant by “throwing coins to someone without ever having seen him”? Why is that important?  How might we “see” who we donate to, especially as we head into Lent?
13.	How can despair help us to go deeper into our prayers and our relationship with God? How does Metropolitan Anthony suggest that we so first thing in the morning?  Why is it important?  How might we sabotage our prayer life?
14.	What are your thoughts on “it does work, if you are simple enough to do it”?  St Porphyrios tells us to ask God to give us the “strength to lead a simple spiritual life”…Why is the word “simple” profound in our Orthodox lives?
