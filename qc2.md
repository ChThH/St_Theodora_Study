## Knocking At The Door
1)	Are you able to sense the depth that you are “outside” of the kingdom of God?
2)	What is meant by increasing progression towards a deeper, richer, longing for the presence of God?
3)	Have you ever heard the saying: “You will never see a hearse pulling a U-Haul”.  How do our possessions and wealth burden us, and keep us from the kingdom of God?
4)	What are the Beatitudes? Discuss the first Beatitude.
5)	Why does Jesus say to His disciples, “Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven…” (Matthew 19:23)? 
6)	How can our imagination entangle us?
7)	Discuss: “Find the door of your heart, you will discover it is the door of the kingdom of God.”
